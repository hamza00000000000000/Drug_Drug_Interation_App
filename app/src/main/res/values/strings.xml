    <string name="disease_string">A disease is an abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or
        function of all or part of an organism, and that is not immediately due to any external injury.[1][2]
        Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms.
        A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions. For example,
        internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various
        forms of immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies and autoimmune disorders.
        In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction,
        distress, social problems, or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for those in contact
        with the person. In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes,
        infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while
        in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories. Diseases can
        affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter
        the affected person\'s perspective on life.
        Death due to disease is called death by natural causes. There are four main types of disease: infectious diseases,
        deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases (including both genetic diseases and non-genetic hereditary diseases),
        and physiological diseases. Diseases can also be classified in other ways, such as communicable versus
        non-communicable diseases. The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood flow obstruction),
        followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections.[3] In developed countries, the diseases
        that cause the most sickness overall are neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety.
        The study of disease is called pathology, which includes the study of etiology, or cause.</string>
    <string name="dose_indication_string">
        Indication: 1. In medicine, a condition which makes a particular treatment or procedure advisable.
        CML (chronic myeloid leukemia) is an indication for the use of Gleevec (imatinib mesylate). 2. A
        sign or a circumstance which points to or shows the cause, pathology, treatment, or outcome of an attack of disease.
        The presence of the Philadelphia chromosome in peripheral blood cells is an indication of a relapse in CML.
        In medicine, an indication is a valid reason to use a certain test, medication, procedure, or surgery.[1]
        There can be multiple indications to use a procedure or medication.[2] An indication can commonly be confused
        with the term diagnosis. A diagnosis is the assessment that a particular [medical] condition is present while
        an indication is a reason for use.[3] The opposite of an indication is a contraindication,[4] a reason to withhold
        a certain medical treatment because the risks of treatment clearly outweigh the benefits.
        In the United States, indications for prescription drugs are approved by the FDA. Indications are included in the
        Indications and Usage section of the Prescribing Information. The primary role of this section of labeling is to
        enable health care practitioners to readily identify appropriate therapies for patients by clearly communicating
        the drug’s approved indication(s). The Indications and Usage section states the disease or condition, or manifestation
        or symptoms thereof, for which the drug is approved, as well as whether the drug is indicated for the treatment,
        prevention, mitigation, cure, relief, or diagnosis of that disease or condition. Additionally, the Indications and
        Usage section should contain the approved age groups as well as other information necessary to describe appropriate
        use (e.g., identifying the indicated patient/disease subgroups, stating if adjunctive therapy is required).
